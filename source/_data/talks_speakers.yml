  speaker_role: CSA Technologies Inc founder
  speaker_bio: "I am a full-stack developer with over 20 years of experience. I specialize in front-end development using Angular platform.
I am a founder of CSA Technologies Inc, which allows me to empower companies with my consulting work. I am also a mother of 5 remarkable children.
My expertise in the industry has been motivating me to share my knowledge with other mothers. I have seen a real change over the years in the IT sector, with more women joining the programming teams.
There is a significant demand for mentors who can empower and teach new programmers to navigate this sector. There is an abundance of technical knowledge on the internet but a lack of interpersonal relationships building tools.
My goal is to empower women to code and to have a fulfilling career while raising a family.
In 2021 I started running a free weekly workshop where I teach how to get started with Angular."

        talk_description: "If youâ€™re working on a project that has been around for a while, chances are thereâ€™s a few cobwebs ðŸ•¸ on some parts of your codebase that make you cringeâ€¦
This is a totally normal part of the natural growth of an application. But how can we improve our software and correct past mistakes in a sustainable way, and without massively blowing out the scope? ðŸ¤”
Letâ€™s discuss an incremental approach to dealing with mature codebases! We will take some ideas from genetic ðŸ§¬ algorithms and micro-service architectures, and combine them with code analysis and snapshot ðŸ“¸testing, and look at a pragmatic, evolutionary approach to codebase health and maintenance."
