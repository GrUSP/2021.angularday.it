  speaker_role: CSA Technologies Inc founder
  speaker_bio: "I am a full-stack developer with over 20 years of experience. I specialize in front-end development using Angular platform.
I am a founder of CSA Technologies Inc, which allows me to empower companies with my consulting work. I am also a mother of 5 remarkable children.
My expertise in the industry has been motivating me to share my knowledge with other mothers. I have seen a real change over the years in the IT sector, with more women joining the programming teams.
There is a significant demand for mentors who can empower and teach new programmers to navigate this sector. There is an abundance of technical knowledge on the internet but a lack of interpersonal relationships building tools.
My goal is to empower women to code and to have a fulfilling career while raising a family.
In 2021 I started running a free weekly workshop where I teach how to get started with Angular."

        talk_description: "If youâ€™re working on a project that has been around for a while, chances are thereâ€™s a few cobwebs ðŸ•¸ on some parts of your codebase that make you cringeâ€¦
This is a totally normal part of the natural growth of an application. But how can we improve our software and correct past mistakes in a sustainable way, and without massively blowing out the scope? ðŸ¤”
Letâ€™s discuss an incremental approach to dealing with mature codebases! We will take some ideas from genetic ðŸ§¬ algorithms and micro-service architectures, and combine them with code analysis and snapshot ðŸ“¸testing, and look at a pragmatic, evolutionary approach to codebase health and maintenance."

        talk_title: "NoSQL Data Modeling for Front-end Developers"
        talk_description: "Data modeling is the process of figuring out how data should be represented and stored in your software system. Effective data models must balance between application needs, database performance characteristics and the structure of the data itself.
        But why would you care about data modeling if youâ€™re an Angular developer? Well, understanding how data flows through your application, will help you consume your backend API in a more efficient way.
        In this talk, weâ€™ll go through the basics of data modeling - from identifying relationships and cardinalities, to handling staleness and duplication. Weâ€™ll be discussing the data modeling methodology in the context of MongoDB, a NoSQL document database."

        talk_title: "Destructuring frontend monoliths with Microfrontends"
        talk_description: "From loading Ajax requests in browsers to have full-blown frameworks; Javascript has come a long way. While moving stuff from backend to frontend the problems of backend are also ported. The Bigger the code gets bigger the problems, more dependencies, harder maintainability, eventually all the problems of a huge monolith.
With Microfrontends, we can break this monolith into smaller independent, maintainable apps.
Sounds good? Letâ€™s see how in this talk."
